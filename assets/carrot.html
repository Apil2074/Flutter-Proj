    <h3>Carrot</h3>

    <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; padding: 5px">
      The carrot (Daucus carota subsp. sativus) is a root vegetable, most
      commonly observed as orange in color, though purple, black, red, white,
      and yellow cultivars exist, [2][3][4] all of which are domesticated forms
      of the wild carrot, Daucus carota, native to Europe and Southwestern Asia.
      The plant probably originated in Persia and was originally cultivated for
      its leaves and seeds. The most commonly eaten part of the plant is the
      taproot, although the stems and leaves are also eaten. The domestic carrot
      has been selectively bred for its greatly enlarged, more palatable, less
      woody-textured taproot. The carrot is a biennial plant in the umbellifer
      family, Apiaceae. At first, it grows a rosette of leaves while building up
      the enlarged taproot. Fast-growing cultivars mature within three months
      (90 days) of sowing the seed, while slower-maturing cultivars need a month
      longer (120 days). The roots contain high quantities of alpha- and
      beta-carotene, and are a good source of vitamin K and vitamin B6. The
      United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reports that world
      production of carrots and turnips (these plants are combined by the FAO)
      for 2018 was 40 million tonnes, with 45% of the world total grown in
      China. Carrots are widely used in many cuisines, especially in the
      preparation of salads, and carrot salads are a tradition in many regional
      cuisines.

      Both written history and molecular genetic studies indicate that the
      domestic carrot has a single origin in Central Asia.[2][3] Its wild
      ancestors probably originated in Persia (regions of which are now Iran and
      Afghanistan), which remains the centre of diversity for the wild carrot
      Daucus carota. A naturally occurring subspecies of the wild carrot was
      presumably bred selectively over the centuries to reduce bitterness,
      increase sweetness and minimise the woody core; this process produced the
      familiar garden vegetable.[8][9] When they were first cultivated, carrots
      were grown for their aromatic leaves and seeds rather than their roots.
      Carrot seeds have been found in Switzerland and Southern Germany dating
      back to 2000–3000 BC.[10] Some close relatives of the carrot are still
      grown for their leaves and seeds, such as parsley, cilantro, coriander,
      fennel, anise, dill and cumin. The first mention of the root in classical
      sources is from the 1st century AD;[11] the Romans ate a root vegetable
      called pastinaca,[12] which may have been either the carrot or the closely
      related parsnip.[13][14] The plant is depicted and described in the
      Eastern Roman Juliana Anicia Codex, a 6th-century AD Constantinopolitan
      copy of the Greek physician Dioscorides' 1st-century pharmacopoeia of
      herbs and medicines, De Materia Medica. Three different types of carrots
      are depicted, and the text states that "the root can be cooked and
      eaten".[15] The plant was introduced into Spain by the Moors in the 8th
      century.[16] In the 10th century, roots from West Asia, India and Europe
      were purple.[17] The modern carrot originated in Afghanistan at about this
      time.[11] The 11th-century Jewish scholar Simeon Seth describes both red
      and yellow carrots,[18] as does the 12th-century Arab-Andalusian
      agriculturist, Ibn al-'Awwam.[19] Cultivated carrots appeared in China in
      the 14th century, and in Japan in the 18th century.[11] There are many
      claims that Dutch growers created orange carrots in the 17th century to
      honor the Dutch flag at the time and William of Orange.[17][20] Other
      authorities argue these claims lack convincing evidence.[21] Modern
      carrots were described at about this time by the English antiquary John
      Aubrey (1626–1697): "Carrots were first sown at Beckington in
      Somersetshire. Some very old Man there [in 1668] did remember their first
      bringing hither."[22] European settlers introduced the carrot to colonial
      America in the 17th century.[23] Outwardly purple carrots, still orange on
      the inside, were sold in British stores beginning in 2002.[17]
